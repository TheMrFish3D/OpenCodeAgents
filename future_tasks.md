# Future Tasks and Enhancements

This document outlines potential future tasks and enhancements for this multi-agent system.

## 1. Detailed MCP Server Guides

A crucial next step is to create detailed installation and configuration guides for each of the recommended MCP servers in `docs/recommended_mcp_servers.md`.

For each server, the guide should include:
-   Step-by-step installation instructions.
-   A detailed explanation of its configuration options.
-   A practical example of how to use it with one of the agents.

## 2. New Agent Roles

The current set of agents provides a solid foundation. Here are some ideas for new agents that could be added to the team:

-   **`@database_agent`**: An agent specialized in interacting with databases. It could be used to query data, update records, and manage database schemas. This would require a suitable MCP server for database connectivity (e.g., for PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
-   **`@deployment_agent`**: An agent responsible for deploying the application. It could be configured to use tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or serverless frameworks.
-   **`@reporter_agent`**: An agent that can generate reports on the development process, such as code quality metrics, test coverage, or project status updates. This could integrate with tools like SonarQube or code analysis platforms.
-   **`@ux_designer_agent`**: For projects with a user interface, this agent could provide feedback on the user experience and suggest improvements to the UI design.

## 3. More Complex Workflows

With a larger team of agents, more complex workflows can be orchestrated. Here are some ideas:

-   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** The `@orchestrator` could manage a full CI/CD pipeline. When new code is pushed, it could automatically trigger the `@tester` to run tests, the `@reviewer` to perform a code review, and if everything passes, the `@deployment_agent` to deploy the application.
-   **Automated Debugging:** When a test fails, the `@orchestrator` could initiate a debugging workflow. It could use the `@researcher` to look for information about the error, the `@coder` to try different fixes, and the `@tester` to verify the fix.
-   **Proactive Maintenance:** The `@orchestrator` could be scheduled to periodically scan the codebase for potential issues, such as outdated dependencies (using a dependency analysis tool), security vulnerabilities, or code quality degradation.

## 4. Enhanced Project Management Integration

The system could be more tightly integrated with project management tools. For example, the `@orchestrator` could create tickets in Jira or Trello, update their status, and post comments with progress updates. This would likely require a dedicated MCP server for the specific project management tool.

## 5. Context Database for Inter-Agent Communication

For more complex projects, a file-based communication system might become cumbersome. A more advanced solution would be to use a "context database". This could be a simple key-value store or a more structured database where agents can read and write information.

This would allow for:
-   A centralized place for all project-related context.
-   More efficient and reliable communication between agents.
-   The ability to query the context in more complex ways.

Implementing a context database would require designing the database schema and creating a dedicated MCP server to interact with it.
