The purpose of this repo is to develop configuration and documentation for setting up multi-agent workflows using open-code primarily for software development, and other tasks like research and ideating. 
https://opencode.ai/docs/
The intent will be to primarily use models hosted in my network(already running, installation of these not required)
Goals
Create the agents for each of the use cases. 
  example architectures I have seen made for claude code have code agents (generating code), tool agents (using external tools like code interpreters or web searches), data agents (processing and retrieving data), and orchestrator/supervisor agents etc etc. 
  Models I will be using initially are gpt-oss:120b and gpt-oss:20b which support tool use and thinking. 
  Other types of agents might be product designers, architecture agens, test harness builders, testing agents etc etc etc. 
Document setup 
document use 
document setting up the mcp servers for this and a list of which mcp servers to use, integration of those with the agents as nescesary. 
document anything else I might want to build to manage context or whatever.
