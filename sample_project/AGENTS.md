# Project: Command-Line Calculator

This project is a simple command-line calculator written in Python.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to provide a simple, interactive calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## File Structure

- `calculator.py`: The main file containing the calculator's logic.

## How to Run

The calculator can be run from the command line:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

## Agent Instructions

When working on this project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **`@orchestrator`**: Your goal is to manage the development of this calculator. You can start by asking the `@architect` to review the current implementation and suggest improvements.
- **`@architect`**: When asked to review the design, focus on simplicity and correctness. The current implementation is straightforward, but you can suggest improvements like adding more operations or improving the user interface.
- **`@coder`**: When asked to implement changes, make sure to modify the `calculator.py` file. Follow the existing coding style.
- **`@tester`**: Your main task is to add tests for the calculator. You should create a new file, `test_calculator.py`, and write unit tests for the arithmetic functions in `calculator.py`.
- **`@reviewer`**: When reviewing code, ensure that it's correct and easy to understand.
- **`@researcher`**: You can be used to research how to implement new features, for example, "how to add a square root function in python".
